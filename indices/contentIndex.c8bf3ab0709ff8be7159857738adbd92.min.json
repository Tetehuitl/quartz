It will provide you a time-tested foundation as you structure the interests of your digital library.\n\n- 000 - *Knowledge Management*\n- 100  - *Personal Management*\n- 200 - *Philosophy \u0026 Psychology; Spirituality \u0026 Religion*\n- 300 - *Social Sciences*\n- 400 - *Communications \u0026 Rhetoric; Language \u0026 Linguistics*\n- 500 - *Natural Sciences*\n- 600 - *Applied Sciences*\n- 700 - *Art \u0026 Recreation*\n- 800 - *Literature*\n- 900 - *History \u0026 Biography \u0026 Geography*\n\nIt is ready-made to hold your diverse interests. Add some placeholders below. \n\n---\n\n## 000 - Knowledge Management\nThe [[Meta PKM]] shows the best practices of knowledge management. I use the [[LYT Kit]] to show the power of linked thinking and to empower others to develop their thinking. The [[Mapping MOCs]] is my personal note to wrap my head around the wondrous beauty that MOCs offer. Others include:\n\n- [[Notebox]] | [[LOL]] |  [[I want to...]]\n- [[Cartographer's Corner ðŸ—º]] | [[Commonplace Book]] |  [[Knowledge and memory MOC]]\n\n## 100 - Personal Management\nThe [[Thinking MOC]] can galvanize my attention; the [[Concepts MOC]] can flavor it; and the [[Habits MOC]] speaks about how to direct it. Hidden within in the [[Cabin]]. Go to my [[Life Map]] to brush up on [[My Virtues (starter)|My Virtues]] and more.\n\n- [[Posture MOC]] | [[Hormesis MOC]] | [[Breathing Exercises MOC]] | Flowcreation MOC\n- People MOC | Family MOC | [[Prominent People (kit)]]\n- Efforts MOC | [[Life Command âŒ˜]] | Plans and Reviews\n- Finances MOC | Health MOC\n\n## 200 - Philosophy, Psychology ; Spirituality, Religion\nIs there no limit to this section? I use [[Philosophy MOC (kit)]] as the big note and then point to things like: [[Stoicism MOC]], [[Confucianism MOC]], [[Religion MOC]], [[Taoism MOC]], and whatever else comes up.\n\n[[Psychology MOC (kit)]] is similar but different enough to have its own space.\n\n## 300 - Social Sciences ðŸ‘¥\n*The study of human society and of individual relationships in and to society.*\nWhile this a very important section, I have found it's a bit more intimate, as strange as that sounds, so I'm hesitant to share too much here. The best place to start is the [[People MOC]]. along with.\n\nSee also: [[People MOC#Prominent People ðŸŒ‹|Prominent People ðŸŒ‹]] | Politics | Society | Law | Relationships\n\n## 400 - Communications, Language, \u0026 Linguistics\nA fun section of the library, the 400s contains the underrated and oft-maligned subject of [[Rhetoric MOC]]. And one cannot talk long about rhetoric without talking about [[Language MOC]], [[Words MOC]], and especially [[Figures MOC]]. Not too far behind is the [[Leadership MOC]].\n\n## 500 - Natural Sciences\nA sharp break from the previous section, the 500s explore the natural world and universe in glorious notes like [[Cosmology MOC]] and [[Math MOC]]. \n\nSee also: Chemistry | Geology | Plants | Animals | [[Systems MOC (kit)]]\n\n## 600 - Applied Sciences\nA natural progression from the previous section, this is where we take the the fundamentals of nature and *apply* them. My undergrad was in [[Engineering MOC]], which relates to my interest in [[Building Homes MOC]]. Later on, I developed the [[Editing Manual MOC]].\n\nSee also: Agriculture | Technology | Medical | [[AI MOC]] | Programming | [[Collective Intelligence MOC]] | [[Genetics MOC]] | \n\n## 700 - Art \u0026 Recreation\nAh the leisures of life. Remember leisure? Few really do. This section could easily balloon. \n\n- Art MOC | [[Design MOC]] | Architecture | Painting | \n- Film \u0026 TV | [[Movies MOC]] \n- Sports | [[Football MOC]] \n- Music | [[Jazz MOC]] | [[Vocals MOC]] \n- [[Cooking MOC]] | Leisure \n\n## 800 - Literature\nIf folks barely remember leisure, they likely completely forgot about classical literature. A great shame, neomania...we blind ourselves to some of humanity's greatest hits. Use [[Literature MOC]] as a launchpad.\n\n## 900 - History \u0026 Biography \u0026 Geography\nI've noticed I'm naturally building up the [[Ancient Greece MOC]], but I haven't cared to build out the [[History MOC]] just yet. The [[Places MOC]] is a peculiarly powerful note that has big things in store for it.\n\nThe [[Art \u0026 Science Storytelling MOC]] look at some great storytellers of history. \n\n---\n\nPlease don't go crazy numbering things. We are just using a pre-made map so we can easily add dots of new interests. \n\nBack to: [[Home]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-23T22:50:53.9663327Z","tags":null},"/notes/Make-swap-file-Linux":{"title":"Make swap file Linux","content":"\nFirst create the swap ile on disk\n```\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=1048576\n```","lastmodified":"2022-10-23T22:50:53.9663327Z","tags":null},"/notes/UEFI-XML-libvirt":{"title":"UEFI XML libvirt","content":"\nhttps://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html","lastmodified":"2022-10-23T22:50:53.9663327Z","tags":null},"/notes/test-page":{"title":"test page","content":"This is a test page to see why the link I made isn't working. \n[Resize_Disk_img](Resize_Disk_img.md)\n\n[index](_index.md)\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-23T22:50:53.9663327Z","tags":null},"/notes/tron-virus-scan":{"title":"tron virus scan","content":"A very coprehensive virus removal and cleanup tool for Windows\n[tron](https://github.com/bmrf/tron/blob/master/README.md)","lastmodified":"2022-10-23T22:50:53.9663327Z","tags":null}}
